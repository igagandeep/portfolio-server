ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This is the backend API server for my full-stack portfolio website, built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It serves as the core of my portfolio management system, enabling dynamic handling of project data through a clean and secure RESTful API.

The API supports all essential CRUD operations, allowing me to add, edit, or delete portfolio projects from a frontend admin interface. Itâ€™s designed with scalability and maintainability in mind and follows modern development practices such as modular route/controllers structure and centralized environment configuration.

The server is fully deployed on Render, and the project data is stored in a MongoDB Atlas cloud database. To ensure a smooth user experience, the backend includes robust error handling and CORS support to securely connect with the frontend hosted separately.
